## My process

In order to complete this challenge I started with the structure of the content in the Html file. Then I move to the css file to begin with the design.
I had no problems with the design of the card. But I had problems with the svg background. I try my best to put the svgs on the right position but in differents screens
the backgroung looks totally different from the original design. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

On this challenge I learn how to use the background-position css property to handle the svg files for the background.


```css
body {
  background-position: top -55vh left -125vw, bottom -55vh right -125vw;
}
```

### Continued development

I believe I have to learn more about style the background with images because on this challenge I had a lot problem with it.
